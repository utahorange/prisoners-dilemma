# prisoners-dilemma

An implementation of the simulation described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&ab_channel=Veritasium) and the strategies mentioned in *More Effective Choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma*. Here's an [overview of the experiment](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/axelrod.html).
## a quick summary of the paper
The video generally notes that strategies that were "nice"(did not defect without cause), "forgiving"(went back to cooperating), and "not a pushover"(retaliated) were the most successful.
## conclusions found in the paper
My hope is this code can allow more people to try this out for their own and write their own strategies.
